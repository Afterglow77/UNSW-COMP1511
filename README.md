## 📖 Course Overview
COMP1511 introduces the fundamental concepts of computer programming and software design. The course focuses on the **C programming language**, emphasizing manual memory management, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

**My Goal:** To build a solid foundation in low-level programming before advancing to object-oriented design and systems programming.

## 📅 Weekly Progress (10-Week Syllabus)

I am following the standard UNSW 10-week trimester structure.

### Phase 1: The C Foundation
- [x] **Week 1: Fundamentals**
  - Setup development environment (VS Code, GCC).
  - Introduction to Linux command line.
  - Basic I/O (`printf`, `scanf`) and compilation workflow.
- [ ] **Week 2: Control Flow**
  - Boolean logic, `if`/`else` branching.
  - Loop structures (`while`, `for`) and input validation.
- [ ] **Week 3: Functions & Arrays**
  - Code modularization using functions.
  - 1D and 2D Arrays manipulation.
  - Debugging techniques.

### Phase 2: Memory & Pointers
- [ ] **Week 4: Pointers & Memory Model**
  - Understanding the Stack vs. Heap.
  - Pointer arithmetic and referencing.
- [ ] **Week 5: Strings & Structures**
  - Character arrays and string library functions.
  - Defining custom data types (`struct`).
  - **Milestone:** Assignment 1 Release.

### Phase 3: Data Structures (Linked Lists)
- [ ] **Week 6: Introduction to Linked Lists**
  - Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`).
  - Building a basic node structure.
- [ ] **Week 7: Advanced Linked Lists**
  - Insertion, deletion, and traversal algorithms.
  - Handling edge cases and memory leaks.

### Phase 4: Professional Engineering
- [ ] **Week 8: Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
  - Information hiding and interface design (`.h` vs `.c`).
  - Stacks and Queues implementation.
  - **Milestone:** Assignment 2 Release.
- [ ] **Week 9: Advanced Topics**
  - Recursion.
  - Time complexity analysis (Big-O notation).
- [ ] **Week 10: Revision & Final Exam Prep**
  - Comprehensive review of C fundamentals.
  - Practice exams and algorithmic challenges.
